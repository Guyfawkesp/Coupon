# Coupon Analysis

This Jupyter notebook analyzes a dataset of coupon acceptance behavior. The analysis focuses on understanding the characteristics of drivers who accept various types of coupons, particularly bar, Coffee House coupons.

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed several key insights:

* **Overall Coupon Acceptance:** A significant proportion of coupons were accepted, indicating a general receptiveness to promotional offers.  A pie chart visualizing the proportion of accepted versus rejected coupons is included in the notebook.
* **Bar Coupon Acceptance:**  Drivers who frequent bars (more than once a month) and are over 25 years old demonstrate a higher acceptance rate for bar coupons.  Additionally, the acceptance rate is influenced by the presence of non-kid passengers and occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry.  A variety of bar plots highlight these findings.

* **Independent Investigation (Coffee House Coupons):**  An additional analysis of coffee house coupons explored the relationship between acceptance and age, as well as the frequency of coffee house visits.  Similar to bar coupons, a pattern emerged where partnered customers who frequented coffee houses atleast once demonstrated higher acceptance rates.

## Further Exploration

The notebook explores various aspects of coupon acceptance, including:

* **Data Cleaning:**  Addressing missing values and inconsistencies within the dataset.
* **Visualizations:**  Generating bar plots, histograms, and pie charts to illustrate data distributions and relationships.

## Jupyter Notebook

## Example:  Visualizations

The notebook includes several visualizations, such as:

* A pie chart showing the proportion of accepted and rejected coupons.
* A collection of bar charts displaying the distribution of various categorical features.
* A histogram illustrating the distribution of temperatures.

These visualizations are crucial for interpreting the data and drawing conclusions about coupon acceptance patterns.
